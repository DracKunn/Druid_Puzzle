Tools of war: 2 rooms and 4 objects from each room and a deck of cards and some d6s. (eg a kitchen, a bedroom and some cutlery, ome books, a teddy…)

Battlefield: 
* Each player picks a room. Decide who will be the attacker and who will be the defender. 

The Squad:
* Divide the deck into the 4 suits. For each of your objects, choose one object, draw 4 cards and keep 2, discard the rest. Compare to the list and these will be the abilities for this item. Some abilities will let you draw more cards, do this until you have chosen all your abilities for the object. Give it a name if you like (e.g. Sergeant Forks).
* Now repeat this for the other 4 objects. 
* {insert the list, each room should have a set of offensive abilities for movement boosts etc in red and more defensive mechanics that utilise furniture in the room for black)}
-> maybe 2-7 is common (simple buff), 8-10 is uncommon (stronger bonus + weakness), jack-king is strong bonus, ace is ultimate powerr

General rules: 
* An object can move 50 cm
* An object will hit with an attack on a 5+
* An object has 10 hitpoints
* An object deals 1 damage with a successful attack
* An object can try to hit another object within a 10 cm radius of it’s center (vecht het uit)

Idea for roguelike elements: each room gets a list of achievements per suit that unlocks progressively better upgrades for the cards in each suit, with a room themed power and synergy.

Example: give two heart upgrades to one object > unlocks the 2 of hearts for that room which now lets that card deal water damage.

Everyone has access to the achievements for 2-7.
1 achievement in a suit unlocks 8-10
2 achievements unlocks jack - king for each suit
3 achievements unlocks ace for each suit
