Tools of war: 2 rooms and 4 objects from each room and a deck of cards and some d6s. (eg a kitchen, a bedroom and some cutlery, ome books, a teddy…)

Battlefield: 
Each player picks a room. Decide who will be the attacker and who will be the defender. 

The Squad:
Divide the deck into the 4 suits. For each of your objects, choose one object, draw 4 cards and keep 2, discard the rest. Compare to the list and these will be the abilities for this item. Some abilities will let you draw more cards, do this until you have chosen all your abilities for the object. Give it a name if you like (e.g. Sergeant Forks).
Now repeat this for the other 4 objects. 
{insert the list, each room should have a set of offensive abilities for movement boosts etc in red and more defensive mechanics that utilise furniture in the room for black)}
